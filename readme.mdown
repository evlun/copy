**copy** performs a deep clone on the supplied value. It currently supports
circular (and non-circular) references, dates, regular expressions, functions,
buffers and typed arrays. Note that copied buffers and typed arrays will still
be views to the same underlying source.

### Usage

```javascript
require('copy')([ 1, 2, 3, { a: 'b' } ]) // -> [ 1, 2, 3, { a: 'b' } ]
```

### Installation

```
npm install copy
```
